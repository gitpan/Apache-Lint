        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        * Brand new distribution, recreated from scratch with
          Module::Starter.  Still don't have tests for it, other than
          the defaults.

        * Correctly and quietly passes along output if the previous
          filter isn't happy, or is a redirect.

0.02    Ancient history, not even worth noting here.
